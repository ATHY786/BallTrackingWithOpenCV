# BallTrackingWithOpenCV
Step #1: Detect the presence of a colored ball using computer vision techniques. 
Step #2: Track the ball as it moves around in the video frames, drawing its previous positions as it moves.
Actually, we’re going to track a Tennis ball in a video stream, using Python, OpenCV color-based threshold.
We’ll also be using imutils to make a few basic tasks (like resizing) much easier.
 
Use follwing command to run $ python ball_tracking.py --video ball_tracking_example.mp4
